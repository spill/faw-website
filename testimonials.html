                    <p class="testimonial-text">"We used to always bring our cars to the dealership for service until we found Fremont Auto Works. We've had mechanical work and auto body work done here, and they are amazing. They're honest and don't try to rip you off with extras. I recently brought my car in because it wouldn't start. Ben said he'll check the battery first before running a bunch of expensive diagnostics. Well, it turned out to be the battery, which he replaced, and now the car is running great. I only wish they were on my insurance's preferred vendor list."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"It is incredibly hard to find an honest mechanic who won't see a girl and automatically think, 'How much can I upcharge her today?' You don't get that vibe from this family-run business as Ben is upfront and meticulously explains what is broken, and what needs to be fixed in great Layman terms. Trustworthy, affordable, excellent, and fast work!"</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"One of our cars needed routine service, plus it was making a strange noise when braking. But our regular auto shop changed owners, so I was on the hunt for a new shop. I fired up Yelp and found the awesome reviews at Fremont Auto Works! I called to make an appointment for the next day, dropped the car off at the appointed time, and hoped for the best. I got a call later in the day with the diagnosis for the noise, approved the cost, and they said the car would be ready in a few hours. I picked up the car at the end of the day, and the issue was resolved."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Wow, I can't believe I haven't updated this review in 14 years. In that time, I've changed my car three times, but every time I've had an issue, Ben is THE guy! What I think makes Ben stand out as a mechanic is that he listens to you! He wants to know about the onset of the car problem, your description of the issue, the sounds your car is making, etc. And by the time you've told him your story, and he's asked a few clarifying questions, he has a few diagnoses to share. He's transparent and honest - still incredibly rare qualities to come by in a mechanic, and let's be honest - in a human. Whenever a friend asks me about a mechanic I'd recommend, that's Fremont Auto Works. Full stop."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"After a bad experience at another shop, I was hesitant to trust anyone else with my car. Fremont Auto Works restored my faith in mechanics. They diagnosed the problem quickly, explained everything clearly, and completed the repair within the timeframe they promised. The pricing was fair and there were no surprise charges. I've found my go-to shop!"</p>
