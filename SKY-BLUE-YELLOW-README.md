## ❌ Why Not Coral?

You're right - coral (#FF6F61) can read as feminine for an auto shop:
- Too pink-toned
- Less common in automotive industry
- Doesn't convey strength/reliability as well

Yellow/amber/gold accents are much better because:
- Classic automotive colors (think warning lights, safety)
- Masculine and industrial
- High contrast with blue
- Convey energy, attention, quality
